                When web developers use the principle of contrast, they make elements on the page that are right next to each other very different colors so they dont' blend together. I think that the people behind designing the lush webpage use contrast very well to present thier products in a way that is in line with what the company is trying to do.

                The rule of thirds is a web disign principle that means you bring important elements of the page to the places where they eye naturally goes. I feel that the playstation store does this well. The division between the menu and the games they are selling is right at the spot where the games are at a better portion of the screen.

            <p>
                When web developers use the white space, or negative space, well they bring attention to the important elements on the webpage. I feel that the apple website uses this principle very well to present products to the consumer. From the screenshot above you can tell the white space around the apple watch makes it stand out on the page.
